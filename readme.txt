Contains:
- UI page for adding wine (wines.php)
- backend function page to control db update (add_wine.php)
- sql database with 'wines' and 'ratings' tables

Main page uses ajax to update the db without reloading the page.
Feel free to change any of it to suit your methods, I just added
that to see how it would work.

To override local repo with current master
"git fetch --all"
"git reset --hard origin/master"  (or whatever the repo <remote>/<branch> is)
